# Resume

Hi all! This is Tanmoy. I'm a **STEM** researcher with 6+ years of experience and am currently **open to work**.  
This is a repository containing my resume and my full profile, both written in **Groff** using the **ms** macro. While the profile is written in plain groff_ms, the cv file features some advanced macro creation and is heavily inspired from Chris Noxz's "Writing a resume in groff" article:

Writing in Groff has been fun, and has become my favorite document processing tool, overtaking LaTeX to the top spot.
