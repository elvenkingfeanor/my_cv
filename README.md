# Resume

Hi all! This is Tanmoy. I'm a **STEM** post-graduate with 6+ years of research and teaching experience. I am currently **open to work**.  
This is a repository containing my resume written in **Groff** using the **ms** macro. The cv features some advanced macro creation and is heavily inspired from Chris Noxz's "Writing a resume in groff" article:

Writing in Groff has been fun, and has become my one of my favorite document processing tool, as it is so minimal. However, LaTeX continues to hold the top spot as it is so versatile, helping me make professional presentations (through LaTeX-Beamer, of course) to official communications to formulating University question papers.
